# Preferred user layout. Can be either `dot` or `xdg`.
#
# XDG layout tries to create as much XDG compliant HOME directory as possible:
#  - XDG_CONFIG_HOME (~/.config) - plain user configuration files
#  - XDG_CACHE_HOME (~/.cache) - long lived cache data
#  - /tmp - short lived cache data
#  - XDG_DATA_HOME (~/.local/share) - main application data
#  - XDG_STATE_HOME (~/.local/state) - application state
#  - ~/.<app> - unsupported applications
#
# As can be seen, xdg is imperfect, as not every application supports redefining its directories (firefox, yarn, etc),
#  as well as does not implement proper functional splitting (configuration, cache, data, and state).
#
# DOT layout tries to force a consistent style across all of the applications:
#  - ~/.config - plain user configuration files
#  - ~/.cache - any intermediate data
#  - ~/.<app> - entire application data, including both state (e.g., sessions,
#    locks), and the main data
#  - ~/.local/share/<app>, ~/.local/state/<app> - a soft link to the ~/.<app>
#    that resolves compatibility issues when directory cannot be changed
#
# Unlike XDG layout, this allows having a single entry point (HOME directory) for both compliant and non-compliant
#  applications.
