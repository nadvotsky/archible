  # NVidia ships its own framebuffer driver that may stuck in case of multiple monitors with different resolution.
  #
  # Parameter below would fallback on using efifb driver (https://docs.kernel.org/fb/efifb.html), which would simply
  #  pick up the first monitor and keep others black (or would set the highest possible resolution for all monitors).
  #
  nvidia_drm.fbdev: "0"
  #
  # If UEFI does not pass correct mode due to the CMS or bug, it can be set manually from `video=efifb:list`:
  #
  # video: "efifb:mode=0"

  #
  # Alternatively, explicit resolution hint for nvidia_drm may be set:
  #
  # {%- set _width = ga_monitors | map(attribute='width') | min() -%}
  # {%- set _height = ga_monitors | map(attribute='height') | min() -%}
  # {%- for _mon in ga_monitors -%}
  #   video={{ _mon.wayland }}:{{ _width }}x{{ _height }}
  # {%- endfor -%}
